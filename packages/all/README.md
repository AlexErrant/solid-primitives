Library of reactive primitives.

> **Warning**
> This collection is solely meant for explorative use. Installing it will add primitives to your `node_modules` that you will never use. Even though we are trying to make our primitives nice and small, this is still somewhat wasteful.
> In the near future, we will provide a script to change your `package.json` to only include those primitives you are actually importing in your code.
> If you actually use all of our primitives, you may henceforth call yourself "user of all solid primitives".

Please refer to the main [README](../../README.md) for a list of primitives.

> **Info**
> The `signal-builder` primitives are exported as `sb.*` in order to avoid conflicts with the `immutable` primitives.
