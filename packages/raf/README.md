Creates a primitive to support requestAnimationFrame.

## Installation

```
npm install @solid-primitives/raf
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/raf
```

## How to use it

```ts
const [running, start, stop] = createRAF(
  (timeElapsed) => console.log('Time elapsed is', timeElapsed))
);
start();
```

## Warning

To respect clients refresh rate, timeElapsed should be used to calculate how much the animation should progress in a frame, otherwise the animation will run faster on high refresh rate screens. As an example: A screen refreshing at 300fps will run the animations 5x faster than a screen with 60fps if you use other forms of time keeping. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame
